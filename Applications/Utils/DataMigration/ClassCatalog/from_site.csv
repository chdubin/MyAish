On the left were socialist ideologies that insisted that women must join the labor force as a matter of establishing equality, while on the right, the growth of yeshivas required women to work to support their families. Yet in spite of all of this, women in the workplace were more the exception than the rule. Today, the Jewish world has come full circle, and many of our young women have taken on dual roles as both mothers and breadwinners.
