            <title> Zionism and the Struggle for Statehood</title>
			<itunes:description>Zionism wasn't Herzl's invention, but he was its driving force. The Zionist ideal got mixed reviews: Reform Jews refused to accept any ties to Israel, while Orthodox rabbis suspected the movement's ulterior motives. Meanwhile, World War I toppled the Ottoman Empire and brought Palestine under British control. Decidedly pro-Arab and anti-semitic, the British weathered 30 years of bloody Arab uprisings and violent Jewish resistance before bowing out to the new State of Israel.</itunes:description>
