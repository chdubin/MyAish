<p>The Jerusalem Western Wall fund is a non-profit Jewish organization dedicated to mass distribution of Torah educational material. </p>

<p>As part of our efforts we have built the ClassicSinai site to inspire, involve and educate Jews who have had little exposure to Torah concepts and the amazing benefits things it can offer their contemporary lives.</p>
