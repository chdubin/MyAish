            <title> 22 - Islam</title>
			<itunes:description>Just as Judaism inspired early Christian religionists, it was also a stepping stone for a young Arab named Mohammed, whose vision was to impose ethical monotheism on his pagan desert culture. Even though Jews rejected his claim of prophecy, Mohammed succeeded to implant Islam within the Arab heart. When Arabia declared jihad on Christianity, hear how the Jews survived within Moslem territory as a separate, albeit as an inferior race.</itunes:description>
