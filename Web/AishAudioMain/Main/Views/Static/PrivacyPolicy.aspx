      <p>These websites take every precaution to protect users' information. When users submit personally identifiable information via the websites, the information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter personally identifiable information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just &quot;surfing&quot;. While we use SSL encryption to protect personally identifiable information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the personally identifiable information mentioned above, is restricted in the offices of Capalon, our ecommerce and web host. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. If you have any questions about the security at our websites, you can send an email to customer audio@Aishaudio.com. </p>
