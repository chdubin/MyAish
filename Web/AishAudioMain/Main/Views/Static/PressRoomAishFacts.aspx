							<p><a name="MP3"></a><strong>What is MP3 Listening?</strong><p>
							<p>Mp3 has become the short-hand term for the industry-accepted process of compressing audio files to make them small enough to send over the Internet. Audio-classes, books, and music can be downloaded to your computer in a matter of seconds or minutes. For example, on a regular cd, a 4-minute song will use 40 mb of space, or 1/20th of a cd’s capacity. With mp3, it can be compressed to only 4mb, or 1/200th of a cd’s capacity. Now any home computer can download, play and store multiple classes and songs.Day or night, in seconds, you can click on a class and hear it free online at your computer. The software is free and is usually built in. You also can download a 1-hour class in minutes to your computer, and then burn it to a cd, or transfer the file to a portable mp3 player that is connected by a simple patch cord to your computer. In a very short time, you can have hours of Jewish wisdom to go.</p>
							<p>The Sandisk Sansa 512 MB mp3 player is free with an annual membership to Aishaudio.com. This little machine eliminates the need for tapes and cds and holds up to 120 hours of classes. Listen through earphones or beam the sound through your car stereo. This top rated mp3 player features a 'resume' feature so you can pick up with your class right where you left off. It has a built-in microphone to record up to 3 hours of classes or meetings, as well as personal voice messages.</p>
